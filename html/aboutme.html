        <p>
            My name is Nixon, I'm currently 20 studying software development at Indian Hills.<br>
            I got my HiSET in Febuary of 2024 with a 89/100, a big acomplishment for me for me. I'm glad I did it even though it was hard, so I can now be where I currently am acedemic wise.

            Hobby wise I love to read and write, both of which I've been doing since I was a kid. Another thing I picked up not to long ago is 3D animation through the use of SFM and Blender. Been doing that for about 6 months and have a lot of fun with it. I also spend a lot of my free time with my cats, I have three; Nacho, Bj, Fanta, they're all a handfull.
