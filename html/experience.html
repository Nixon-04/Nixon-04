                    Culvers is a fastfood chain that I've worked for about 2 almost 3 years now. Fast food requires a lot of critical thinking, problem solving, and social skills, along with the ability to solve a problem quickly.

                            Pizza Hut is a pizza chain that I worked for about 3 months. At Pizza Hut I learned a lot about how to do things very fast but also correctly. That while yes you should be fast, don't let speed effect the quality of your work.
